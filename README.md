# Writing Sandbox

## About the Program

"Writing Sandbox" is a website/extension where users can practice writing in English. It is mainly for Korean programmers since it provides sample sentences of programming related topics. 

## About this open-source project

Anyone can contribute to this project. Please note that this project is not only to make this program, but to use this project as an environment where you can write in English. So every communication in the process will be done in English. Don't worry about your mistakes or errors. If you want your comments or messages to be corrected, please mention @nassol, and she'll give feedback on what you wrote. Those who can give feedback in English are also welcome to join!  

## Usage Flow

There are two kinds of users: user and admin.

### User-side

- A user logs into the service. 
- He chooses a category to practice. 
- He sees a sentence in Korean.
- He writes a sentence in English.
- He types enters, and a sentence which Admin has registered in advance will show up.
- He compares it with what he has written.
- He goes on.

### Admin-side

- An admin logs into the service.
- He chooses a category to register sentences.
- He types in a pair of English and Korean sentences, with its source URL, where he's found them.
- He can order the registered sentences in a different way. Basic principle is that easy ones come first.
