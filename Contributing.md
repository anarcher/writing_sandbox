#Contributing to Writing sandbox

## Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us improve by submitting an issue to our
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/leehosung/writing_sandbox/issues/new). Even better you can submit a
**Pull Request** with a fix. Your custom changes can be crafted in a repository fork and submitted
to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/leehosung/writing_sandbox/compare)

## Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/leehosung/writing_sandbox/issues/new). If you would like to
implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on our [Chatiing rooms](https://gitter.im/leehosung/writing_sandbox), so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/leehosung/writing_sandbox/compare) as a Pull Request.

## Git Guide lines

The Writing sandbox project uses the [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) model for branching.

## Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes must be tested by one more functional or unit tests.
* We follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
